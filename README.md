# FIFA_19_Players
Why not use data analytics for gaming? Seems almost like cheating but it isnâ€™t. 
In this project I analyzed the FIFA 19 player stats to figure out what are the best players in the game, 
who are the most promising young players, and some other interesting stuff.

The short version:
Through SQL queries I analyzed the data to answer some questions:
1.	Who are the top 11 best players in the game?
2.	Who are the most promising young players in the game?
3.	What countries have the greatest number of great players?
4.	What countries have the greatest number of promising players?
5.	Who are the best players for a 4-3-3 formation?
